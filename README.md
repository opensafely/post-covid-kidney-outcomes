# Long-term kidney outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection

This is the code and configuration for our research: "Long-term kidney outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection"

This project is ongoing. Results in this repository MUST NOT be considered an accurate or valid representation of the study purpose. These data may reflect an incomplete or incorrect analysis with no further ongoing work. The repository content has ONLY been made public to support the OpenSAFELY open science and transparency principles and to support the sharing of re-usable code for other subsequent users. The results have not been peer-reviewed. No clinical, policy or safety conclusions must be drawn from any of the data here.

* Our study protocol can be found [here](https://github.com/opensafely/post-covid-kidney-outcomes/blob/main/Protocol_%20Kidney%20outcomes%20after%20SARS-CoV-2%20infection.pdf)
* This study is ongoing and is yet to be published()
* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, will be in `released_outputs/`
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org)
